    <h2><a href="/2014/11/18/meetup-report.html">Nov 18 Meetup Notes</a></h2>

<p>18 November 2014</p>

<p>We got a bit of a late start, but we covered a lot of ground quickly.</p>

<p>We’ve got some events coming up, starting in early 2015, that we need to get planning on. First one is the one-year anniversary event in February 2015, and then the National Day of Civic Hacking will happen sometime in late spring. In between, we hear rumblings about a regional event for the many brigades in New England. </p>

<p><img src="/images/photos/20141118_190929-600.png" alt="Shawn Andrews, formerly the RI legislature's social media resource, talking to people about working with that organization" /></p>

<p>Also, we need to get ready to take over responsibility for maintaining the projects that the <a href="http://codeisland.tumblr.com/">CfA Fellows</a> created for the RI Department of Education. </p>

<p>And, check it out…it’s a website! We’re using the Jekyll platform…here, <a href="http://github.com/codeisland/codeisland.github.io/">check it out in our repo</a> sent out the DNS change in the meeting. Lots of thanks to Alex Taylor and Joe Alba for help getting it looking so spiffy. </p>

<p>Next, we broke into our workgroups and moved things ahead. </p>
<h2><a href="/2014/10/22/questionnaire-project-complete.html">Open Data Questionnaire Project Complete</a></h2>

<p>22 October 2014</p>

<p><strong>Project: Open Data Questionnaire 
<br />STATUS: Complete!</strong></p>

<p>Code Island has completed its first project! We created a <a href="/projects/open-data-questionnaire/">questionnaire asking the Providence mayoral candidates to go "on the record"</a> with their positions on open data...<a href="/projects/open-data-questionnaire/responses/">and they responded</a>. We published the responses, and hopefully, they had an impact on the race.

<h3>The What and the Why</h3>

<p>Code Island draws together many of Rhode Island's leading advocates for open data and open government. As such, wanted to get these issues into the public debate in the 2014 Rhode Island elections. Like many advocacy organizations, we chose to send candidates a questionnaire.</p>

<p>However, we were late to the party. We began our efforts about two weeks before the mid-September primaries, so we could not impact those elections, which in many cases in Rhode Island, are more important than the general election.</p> 

<p>Nor did we feel we could adequately craft highly specific questions for the full range of races in which these issues would be important. Instead, we concentrated on the one election we felt we could influence: the race to replace Angel Taveras as mayor of Providence.</p> 

<p>While the Taveras administration has made substantial improvements by prioritizing access to government data, the city still ranks poorly compared to other cities in the US. His administration not only empaneled a mayoral commission (three of which commissioners are members of the brigade, BTW), but they also acted on several of the commission's recommendations. This alone sets this administration apart from all its predecessors.</p>

<p>But still, the city is a laggard compared to its peers. Code Island wants to make sure the next administration works even harder to catch up.</p>

<h3>Crafting the Questions</h3>

<p>We started by using the <a href="http://opendatapa.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/pastatewideopendataquestionaire.pdf">questionnaire created by Code for Philadelphia and Open Pittsburgh</a>. But we didn't copy the questions verbatim. Instead, the project lead Shawn Selleck, who is also Code Island's Community Organizer and a civic technology consultant to the city of Providence, dug deep into the nitty gritty to frame each question with specific facts about the status of open data in Providence.</p>

<p>The questions we sent to three major mayoral candidates ranged from the severe underfunding of IT to specific datasets that most cities now provide in open standards format. One question asks if the candidates would require all future vendors to work within open standards.</p> 

<p>While we only could influence this one election this year, Shawn's work has provided a strong platform for the future.</p>

<h3>We Asked; They Responded</h3>

<p>Many civic and advocacy organizations send questionnaires to candidates. Some candidates respond; some don't. But in our case, all three candidates responded, and all of them answered all of our questions.</p>

<p>We think this is meaningful in and of itself. To us, it shows that the issues associated with open data and open government have risen to the level that all candidates feel they must be able to respond to them with specific answers. It's also worth noting that no candidate replied negatively to any question. That is, none of them felt they could say that they are opposed to providing open access to government data.</p>

<p>In 2015, some Rhode Island cities like Pawtucket will hold their municipal elections. 2016 will see elections for all Rhode Island's state legislature seats. 2017 will see yet more municipal elections in cities like Woonsocket. And in 2018, Rhode Island's statewide offices will be up for grabs.</p>

<p>All candidates for major offices would do well to stay abreast of developments in Providence municipal and Rhode Island state governments as they work to improve access to data. And they certainly should expect us to ask them to go on the record about these issues. </p>

<h2><a href="/2014/09/02/meetup-report.html">Early September 2014 Meetup</a></h2>

<p>02 September 2014</p>

<p>Code Island held its second post-summer <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Code-for-America-Brigade/">meetup</a> on September 2nd. As usual, we met at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/10+Davol+Square,+Providence,+RI+02903/@41.824152,-71.4398007,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e4456a8646dbf1:0x2259e0f433c149cf?hl=en">Tri Lab</a>, starting at 6pm. Sadly, your Storyteller arrived late, and the meet-up was already in full swing. I missed the review by co-captain Ryan Kelly of various projects from other brigades around the country as well as the review of the budget visualization project. </p>

<p><img src="/images/photos/20140902_185445-600.jpg" alt="About a dozen people sitting around a horseshoe shaped table" /></p>

<p>Just as I sat down, Shawn Selleck started his review of the <a href="/open-data-questionnaire/">candidates questionnaire on open data</a>. This project has two parts. First, we want to define the questions and reach out to candidates. Second, we want to develop a simple, long-text survey results platform that anybody can use to send and receive survey results from political candidates. In order to get our survey to candidates in time for the November general election, we’ll have to use an existing technology like Google Forms and finish the platform after the elections.</p>

<p>That topic sparked a lot of discussion about how specific we could hope to get with questions. It took us all the way to 8pm, when we broke up to let folks get home. Ryan, Thom and I stuck around and took care of house keeping.</p>
<h2><a href="/2014/08/27/meetup-report.html">Late August 2014 Meetup</a></h2>

<p>27 August 2014</p>

<p>After an unexpectedly long summer haitus, Code Island resumed our regular <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Code-for-America-Brigade/">meetups</a> at 6pm on Tuesday, August 19th at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/10+Davol+Square,+Providence,+RI+02903/@41.824152,-71.4398007,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e4456a8646dbf1:0x2259e0f433c149cf?hl=en">Tri Lab in Davol Square</a>. In fact, we’ve booked that time at that location on first and third Tuesday of each month through the end of the year. This will be our regular meet-up schedule moving forward.</p>

<p>As one might expect, we spent a good bit of time reviewing the status on current projects. While the <a href="http://www.localwiki.net/ri/">community wiki</a> has only progressed slowly since the big National Day of Civic Hacking Wiki-a-thon, the Green and Healthy Home Initiative website is at the preview stage, which is exciting. It may not launch until early 2015 because the last chunk of content needs to be entered by college students…during breaks.</p>

<p>We got more good news on Code Island’s single biggest and most important project right now—the budget visualization tool. Brigade member Brian McGuirk and his colleagues at RI Office of Management and Budget are preparing to release a large amount of Department of Transportation financial data in a format that allows for “project-based” tracking. This method tracks outflows to specific projects as opposed to tracking simple lines of a budget that are too coarse to provide meaningful insight. With these data in this format, the budget visualization tool should let us create a website that lets ordinary Rhode Islander get a much better idea of how much money the state government spends on what.</p>

<p>One exciting new project came from Community Organizer Shawn Selleck. In addition to consulting for the city of Providence on issues of data transparency, Shawn is a board member of RI’s chapter of Common Cause, the good-government non-profit. Under Shawn’s leadership, Common Cause and Code Island are jointly developing a questionnaire, asking political candidates to state their positions on issues of data transparency and public accessibility. More on that soon, because the election is approach fast!</p>

<p>Finally, brigade co-captain Ryan Kelly gave a presentation on <a href="http://codeisland.github.com">GitHub</a>, a social media-era document management and version control system that is transforming how development happens. GitHub will enable us to work collaboratively regardless of our locations and schedules. Ryan has posted some great Intro to Github-type links on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/112228497378493874687">our G+ community</a>, if you wanted to check them out.</p>
